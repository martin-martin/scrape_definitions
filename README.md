# Get Definitions from Wordreference

Includes code in Ruby and Python that can be included in a webapp to fetch the definitions of a word from [wordreference.com](http://www.wordreference.com/)

If you do, please mention wordreference - they are doing a great job over there!

Currently, the code is self-standing, but can easily be refactored to be included in a webapp. Useful if you just need to call small amounts of information once in a while, and can't (or don't want to) include an iframe into the webapp.
